              The African Wine Bar hosted one of its flagship events, "The Wine
              Down at the Brewery", an intimate wine and food pairing evening at
              Dirty South Brewery on Thursday, 21 August. The night brought
              together guests for a celebration of flavour, culture, and
              connection, curated by founder Tandokuhle Mpinda, a proud South
              Coast local from Margate.

              <br /><br />The evening began at 6:30 pm with a warm welcome
              before guests gathered around platters of Dirty South Brewery
              favourites. Tables were filled with the Cowboy T-Bone Steak,
              sliced and shared, alongside baskets of crispy hot wings and the
              brewery’s Mighty Basket, which brought together riblets, pap
              balls, samoosas, and other crowd-pleasers. The food set the tone
              for a relaxed, communal atmosphere where conversation flowed
              easily and guests connected long before the first glass was
              poured.

              <br /><br />With plates cleared, the wine journey began. Guests
              first raised a glass of Yeah Baby Yeah (YBY) Crystal Dry, a crisp
              sparkling wine whose playful name captures a spirit of joy and
              celebration. This opening set the mood for the tasting and paved
              the way for the Montpellier Spyseniersberg Chenin Blanc, whose
              freshness paired naturally after the hearty platters. The third
              pour, Essay Red Blend, added layers of spice and earthy character,
              before the evening closed with the bold Montpellier Spyseniersberg
              Red, a wine that delivered richness and depth as a fitting finale
              to the experience.

              <br /><br />Reflecting on the event, Mpinda said:
              <em
                >"Sharing food before the tasting opened people up. It created a
                welcoming energy. From there, the wines were not just about
                tasting notes, they were part of a shared story."</em
              >

              <br /><br />As one of its flagship formats, Wine at the Brewery
              highlights the African Wine Bar’s vision of bringing people
              together around wine in settings that are warm, engaging, and
              approachable. Beyond public events, the African Wine Bar is also
              available to book as a private bar for special occasions,
              corporate functions, and intimate gatherings, offering a unique
              space where food, wine, and community come together.

              <br /><br />The Margate event reinforced the African Wine Bar’s
              role in shaping memorable wine experiences on the South Coast and
              left guests looking forward to the next opportunity to raise a
              glass together at Dirty South Brewery.
