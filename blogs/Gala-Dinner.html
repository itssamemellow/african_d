                On the 3rd of May 2025, The African Wine Bar in collaboration with Eighteen13 attended an exclusive Gala Dinner hosted by Chef Vee, the ambiance exuded opulence and set the tone for the evening.
              </br></br>The African Wine Bar and Eighteen13 attended as the official wine service providers, our vast knowledge in wine and food pairing being the most pivotal strength we bring to every event and soirée. 
              </br></br>The evening started off with Chef Vee welcoming his guests to an evening of culinary delight and expressed that; “Over the next few hours, they would eat fat, salt, sugar, protein, bacteria, fungi, various plants, animals and at times, entire ecosystems.” Chef Vee implored his guests of but one thing; “Please do not eat but rather Taste, Savour,  Relish and Consider every morsel they place inside their mouths. Be mindful. But do not eat.” 
              </br></br><strong>Entrée:</strong> a choice between 
              <ul>
                  <li>Pea & spinach risotto with asparagus, truffle oil and parmesan shaving or Starter </li>
                  <li>Pan-seared scallops with a creamy garlic sauce and herb oil</li>
              </ul>
              </br></br><strong>Mains:</strong> a choice between 
              <ul>
                  <li>Pan-seared duck breast with duck fat seared fondant potato, asparagus, and a redcurrant jus</li>
                  <li>Fillet of pan-seared salmon with peas, spinach, courgette, and a butter sauce</li>
                  <li>Medium beef fillet with portobello mushroom, asparagus, and butter sauce</li>
              </ul>
              </br></br><strong>Dessert:</strong>
              <ul>
                  <li>Red Wine Poached Pears with Vanilla Ice Cream</li>
              </ul>
              </br></br>The very same can be said of the Wine offerings that The African Wine Bar brought to the table:
              <ul>
            </br><li>African Diamond - Grenache Blanc</li>
                  <li>Danie JNR - Red blend</li>
                  <li>TSW - Syrah</li>
                  <li>Mcfarlene -Capitoline Wolf White Blend</li>
                  <li>Malherbe Chenin Blanc</li>
                  <li>Mason Road GSM</li>
                  <li>Barebones - methode Ancestral</li>
                  <li>Montpellier Chardonnay</li>
              </ul>
              </br>Indeed these handpicked selections of wine are to be savoured, relished and considered with each sip. 
              </br></br>The rest of the evening was a culinary celebration and heaps of laughter as guests were treated to a stand up comedy session by Boss Comedian. If anything the room was full of positivity and light, to end the night a DJ had everyone on their feet and dancing the night away.
