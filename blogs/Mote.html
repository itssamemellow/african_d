              African Diamond Wines treated guests to a beautiful wine tasting
              at Wine Wednesday's much anticipated relaunch at MOTE “Monkey On
              The Elephant” in Fourways on the 26th of March 2025.

              <br /><br />Wine Wednesday made its coveted return in style,
              sparing no expenses to give guests nothing but the very best. So
              of course African Diamond Wine was in the building, as the
              Billionaires choice nothing else made sense.

              <br /><br />Guests came flocking in and marvelled at the beauty of
              both our Grenache Noir and Grenache Blanc, siting that they've
              never tasted anything quite like it, many saying they've been
              “converted” and will be making the switch to African Diamond, and
              that is exactly what they did!. Many made African Diamond Wines
              their drink of choice for the rest of the evening and stocked for
              home.

              <br /><br />Wine Wednesday is a great event that celebrates wine
              and creates a space for wine lovers to connect and be exposed to
              local and black owned wine brands that they otherwise wouldn't
              have known about. The event is exactly the type of event African
              Diamond Wines want to be affiliated with, an event that uplifts
              and opens up space because we believe there is enough room in the
              table for all of us.

              <br /><br />As the rest of the evening progressed, live
              performances from well know DJs and performers commenced and the
              likes of DJ Tira were among them.

              <br /><br />African Diamond Wines is looking forward to
              collaborating with Wine Wednesday again in the near future.
