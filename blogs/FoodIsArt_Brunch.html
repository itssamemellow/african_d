              The Food Is Art Brunch returned this past weekend and once again,
              it delivered an unforgettable experience that blended fine dining,
              soulful music, and South African excellence. Hosted at The Old
              Orchard, a breathtaking venue surrounded by panoramic mountain
              views, the afternoon unfolded under golden sunlight, celebrating
              the harmony between food, wine, and creativity.

              <br /><br />Curated by Viwe, founder of Food Is Art, this second
              edition proved that culinary storytelling is indeed a form of art.
              Guests were treated to a luxurious 7-course culinary journey, each
              dish crafted with precision and paired perfectly by Tandokuhle,
              CEO of African Wine Bar, who led a captivating wine pairing
              education session that left guests both enlightened and inspired.

              <br /><br />The menu featured an elegant progression from a beef
              rasher appetizer paired with Montpellier Spyseniersberg Red, to
              the garlic butter lamb chops paired with the same vintage
              favorite, and a dreamy finale of poached pear with mascarpone and
              caramel complemented by YBY Sparkling. Each course celebrated
              local flavors with a modern twist, beautifully matched with
              boutique South African wines.

              <br /><br />Three expert barmen from African Wine Bar poured and
              presented each wine with grace and sophistication, adding a touch
              of theatre to every glass served. The experience was seamless
              refined yet warm, elegant yet deeply personal.

              <br /><br />As the music played, the energy in the air shifted
              guests couldn’t resist dancing, their spirits lifted by the rhythm
              and the wine. The event was completely sold out, a testament to
              its growing reputation as one of the most distinctive culinary
              experiences in the region.

              <br /><br />By the end of the afternoon, the chant was unanimous
              “We want more!” Many guests even purchased bottles of their
              favorite wines to take home, a true reflection of the success of
              the pairings and the emotional connection sparked by the event.

              <br /><br />The Food Is Art Brunch once again proved that when
              food, wine, and creativity come together, magic happens. It was
              more than a meal it was a multisensory celebration of African
              excellence, artistry, and passion.
