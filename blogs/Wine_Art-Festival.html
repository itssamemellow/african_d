              African Diamond Wines was honoured to be invited to showcase at
              the first instalment of the Wine and Art Festival, hosted by
              Airports Company South Africa, at King Shaka International Airport
              on 1 and 2 March, 2025.

              <br /><br />This two-day event shone a spotlight on small,
              up-and-coming businesses such as wine owners and artists in all
              their forms and proffered them with exposure to a market they
              otherwise wouldn't have had access to. These are the kind of
              initiatives and opportunities that ACSA and the government are
              creating for Proudly South African Youth in Business.

              <br /><br />From engaging business conversations to inspiring
              artistic showcases, the festival brought together industry
              leaders, entrepreneurs, and creatives for a memorable experience.

              <br /><br />Attendees had the opportunity to explore ACSA's
              business opportunities, network with key decision-makers from
              CAPEX Infrastructure, Property, Retail and Commercial in addition
              to connecting with visionary, young designers and artists whose
              work captures the essence of South Africa.

              <br /><br />Proudly South African winemakers such as The African
              Diamond showcased their finest selections, while a stellar lineup
              of artists -including Shekhinah, DJ Sox, DJ Sonic and more- set
              the perfect ambience.

              <br /><br />African Diamond Wines showed up and showed off their
              vintage selection, namely, the Grenache Blanc and Grenache Noir.
              Guests were left speechless after being offered a taste test,
              often citing they'd never tasted anything like it and wanting
              more.

              <br /><br />The Wine and Art Festival was a success and African
              Diamond Wines simply cannot wait for the following one.
